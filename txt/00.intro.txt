tmuxtutor.intro
===============

Welcome to tmuxtutor!

== Requirements

* Install tmux
* You should know how to navigate in a man page/less command
* You should know what the Meta (or Alt) keys is

== Usage

This tutorial is intended to be viewed interactively. The HTML version is
available here: https://perlpunk.github.io/tmuxtutor/

Most of these tutorials are started with a command like this:

    tmux new-session -s demo "man man/01.basics.man"

So it will start a new tmux session called "demo" and the command man
`man/01.basics.man`. This means if you leave the man command with `q` this
will close the tmux window, and (if you haven't opened more windows)
also the session.

If you want to try out things in an extra session, simply start your own.
It's a good habit to start every session with a name.

    tmux new-session -t play

== tmux configuration ~/.tmux.conf

This tutorial assumes you haven't created a tmux configuration yet.
If you have, then some things might work and look differently than with
the default setup.

== Start

Now exit this intro with `q` and run

    ./01.basics.sh
    ./02.prefix.sh
    ./03.windows.sh
    ./04.panes.sh
    ./05.layouts.sh
    ./06.synchronize.sh
