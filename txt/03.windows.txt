= Working with windows

You are in window 0 right now. To go to this window from
anywhere, type

    PREFIX + 0

Let's open a a new window with

    PREFIX + c

You will be in that new window number 1 now and see an additional
entry in the status bar at the bottom.

== Navigating windows

You can interactively choose any window by typing

    PREFIX + w

This will give you a list of windows in your session.

Windows with numbers 0-9 are a bit easier to access. Just
type

    PREFIX + n

where n is the window number.

Another possibility is to be prompted for the number:

    PREFIX + '

lets you type in a number, so this is especially useful for windows
with an index greater than 9.

You can also navigate to the last recently used window with

    PREFIX + l

Play around by opening/closing windows and navigating
between them.

Go to the next

    PREFIX + n

or previous window

    PREFIX + p

== Window titles

You can give a title to a window with:

    PREFIX + ,

You can see the window titles in the status bar.

If you want to move the window to another position, type:

    PREFIX + .

You can now enter the new position.
