Working with windows

You are in window 0 right now. To go to this window from
anywhere, type

    PREFIX + 0

Let's open a a new window with

    PREFIX + c

You will be in that new window number 1 now and see an additional
entry in the status bar at the bottom.

== Navigating windows

You can interactively choose any window by typing

    PREFIX + w

This will give you a list of windows in your session.

Windows with numbers 0-9 are a bit easier to access. Just
type

    PREFIX + n

where n is the window number.

Another possibility is to be prompted for the number:

    PREFIX + ' (single quote)

lets you type in a number, so this is especially useful for windows
with an index greater than 9.

You can also navigate to the last recently used window with

    PREFIX + l

Play around by opening/closing windows and navigating
between them.

Go to the next

    PREFIX + n

or previous window

    PREFIX + p

If you want to move the window to another position, type:

    PREFIX + . (dot)

You can now enter the new position. Note that the new window index must be
free (not used by a window).

You can swap two windows with the command

    PREFIX + :swap-window -t -1
    PREFIX + :swap-window -t +1

== Window titles

You can give a title to a window with:

    PREFIX + , (comma)

You can see the window titles in the status bar.

If you don't give a title, it will be automatically set to the name of
the process, usually your shell.

Open a new window with

    PREFIX + c

The title will be your shell (e.g. bash, zsh, ...). Now type:

    sleep 5

You'll see the title changes to `sleep`, and when the process finishes,
it will be renamed back. This can be very handy if you run a long process
in another window - you'll be able to see when it finishes. You can also
configure to be notified about that in the status line,

== Closing windows

Typing exit or `CTRL-d` will close a shell and the window, but there's also
a command:

    PREFIX + &

It asks for confirmation.
