Welcome to tmuxtutor!

== Prefix key

For every command in tmux you have to type a PREFIX. By default, this
is
    CTRL-b

Before we start: To get back from a tmux dialogue or display, you
can use

    q

or

    ESCAPE

Sometimes you get error messages, and they will only be displayed for
a second. To see the last error messages, type

    PREFIX + ~ (tilde)

== Basic commands

Ok, let's try our first command.

To show the current time, type

    PREFIX + t

That is, type the PREFIX and then `t`. But it also works if typed all at
the same time.

To get a list of all keys that are bound to a command, type

    PREFIX + ?

Every key is listed with the exact command it is bound to. All
available commands are listed in the man page.

To close this or other tutorials, just type

    q

which will end the `less` *and* close the window.

== Sessions

tmux has sessions. A session can have several windows, and
a window can have several panes.

This tutorial is started as a session called "demo" which
you should be able to see in the status bar at the bottom.

You can detach a session by typing

    PREFIX + d

You will be back in the shell where you started the session.

To reattach to this session, type

    tmux attach -t demo

If there is only one session, you can omit the -t option.

    tmux ls
    tmux list-sessions

will list all your tmux sessions.
