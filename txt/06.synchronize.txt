tmuxtutor.synchronize
=====================

Synchronizing panes means, that everything you type in one pane, will
be typed into all other panes in the window.

You could use this for ssh to a number of different hosts and run a
command, compare the output, etc.

Or to compare the outputs of a program for several versions of your
language interpreter.



To try out synchronising you either have to open a new tmux window
or another terminal, so that you can still read this manpage.

To open a new session in a new terminal, type

    tmux new-session -s sync

To open a new tmux window, type

    PREFIX + c

Now open 4 (or as many as you like) panes. In every new pane, type

    NAME=some.name
    NAME=other.name
    ...

Now activate synchronizing with

    PREFIX + :set synchronize-panes on

Then echo the variable:

    echo "Hello $NAME!"

To deactivate, type

    PREFIX + :set synchronize-panes off

Leaving out the 'on' or 'off' will toggle the option.

    PREFIX + :set synchronize-panes

If you do this more often, it might be a good idea to bind this to a key.

= Scripting

Synchronizing is a good use case for scripting tmux.

In `examples/06a.synchronize-perlbrew.sh` you will find a script that
compares four perl versions with each other, via `perlbrew`.
Maybe replace this with `plenv`, `rbenv` or any other interpreter
switching tool and try it out.
