Working with panes

Windows are nice, but often you want to see several windows
at the same time; for viewing log files, showing the output of
your test suite, manage your git commits etc.

For that, tmux has panes inside of windows.

Splitting a window into two panes is easy. To split
vertical, type

    PREFIX + %

To split horizontally, use

    PREFIX + "

So now create a new pane by PREFIX + %. The new pane is
automatically focused.

To navigate, you can use the arrow keys. So to go back to
this pane, type

    PREFIX + Left

To quickly navigate between two panes, use

    PREFIX + ;

Remember:

    Last window: PREFIX + l
    Last pane:   PREFIX + ;

To go to the next pane, type

    PREFIX + o

Remember you can always type

    PREFIX + ?

to get a list of all keys.


To see all pane numbers, and to navigate to a pane, type

    PREFIX + q

You will see a number displayed in every pane for two seconds.
The active one is displayed in red.
You can then type in the number to navigate to that pane.

== Move panes around

Two swap a pane with the previous/next one, type

    PREFIX + {
    PREFIX + }

== Zooming panes

Now, let's say you have two vertical panes, so they have only half of
the size of your terminal. This can sometimes be problematic.

You'll notice that you cannot copy content from just one pane.
When you cannot use the tmux copy & paste, you want to be able
to select content like you do in your normal terminal.

Or wou want to show a side-by-side diff with vimdiff and just
need more space.

There is a shortcut for temporarily zoom in/out a pane with

    PREFIX + z

Try it with this one here. To unzoom, just use the same key again.
