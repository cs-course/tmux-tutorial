Welcome to tmuxtutor!

For every command in tmux you have to type a PREFIX. By default, this
is
    CTRL-b

Let's try our first command.

To show the current time, type

    PREFIX + t

To get back from the time display (or from any dialogue), type

    q

You can also type ESC

To get a list of all keys that are bound to a command, type

    PREFIX + ?
